# EventMiner

EventMiner is developed for CASE 2021 Task 1: Multilingual protest news detection. 

This system is powered by the state-of-the-art general transformer models and sentence transformer models involving 
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. Please refer to the paper [DAAI at CASE 2021 Task 1: Transformer-based Multilingual Socio-political and Crisis Event Detection](https://aclanthology.org/2021.case-1.16/) for more details about this approach and conducted experiments.
